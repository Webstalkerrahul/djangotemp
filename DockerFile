# Step 1: Use the official Python image as a base
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Step 2: Set environment variables
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1

# Step 3: Install system dependencies required for Playwright and PostgreSQL
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    wget \
    ca-certificates \
    libx11-xcb1 \
    libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 \
    libdbus-1-3 \
    libgbm-dev \
    libpq-dev \
    gcc \
    build-essential \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Step 4: Set up a working directory
WORKDIR /app/djangotemp/project

# Step 5: Copy only requirements.txt to install dependencies first (to optimize cache usage)
COPY requirements.txt .

# Step 6: Install Python dependencies (including Playwright)
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 7: Install Playwright and its browser dependencies
RUN pip install playwright && playwright install --with-deps

# Step 8: Copy the rest of the Django project files into the container
COPY . /app/djangotemp/project
ENV PYTHONPATH=/app/djangotemp/project/project
# Step 9: Expose port 8000 for Gunicorn to serve the app
EXPOSE 8000

# Step 10: Define the command to run the app with Gunicorn (a production WSGI server)
CMD ["gunicorn", "core.wsgi:application", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "--workers", "4"]
